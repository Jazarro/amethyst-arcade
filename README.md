This site is intended to be an exhaustive list of open source games made in rust with the Amethyst engine.

Know of some games that aren't here? Open a PR to add them! Simply duplicate one of the files in the content folder and edit the fields.

Personally, for the purpose of learning it, I've decided to create one game every weekend using Amethyst. My goal is to reach 100 games. Join the challenge and add your games here!
